				<h2>I want to help you tell a story.</h2>

				<p>For the past 15 years I’ve written and edited fiction, poetry, plays, grants, advertisements, articles, press releases and entertainment news. I’ve also collaborated on manuscripts for children’s books and speculative fiction. My experience spans academic, non-profit, and for-profit concerns, working with others as a colleague, a freelancer and a volunteer.</p>
				<p>The hundreds of pieces I’ve professionally written, co-written, ghostwritten and edited have been published in forums such as annual reports, conference and theatre programs, commercial and educational Web sites, blogs and traditional news media such as the Atlanta Business Journal and The Coloradoan.</p>
				<p>The musicality of meter, rime, alliteration and assonance flows through much of my writing, from playwriting to formal prose. I studied guitar during high school and college and went on to perform at such venues as Gasoline Alley and the Tarpon Springs Greek Festival in the Greater Tampa Bay area (with the band Brave Ulysses). Music remains a passion for me, one closely entwined with writing. Rhythm, phrasing, melody and cadence are crucial elements of both disciplines. Words should sing, and I train my ear for every possible way to voice a line.</p>
				<p>But enough about me. Tell me what you’re working on, whether it’s a single passage or a volume, and we’ll compose.</p>
